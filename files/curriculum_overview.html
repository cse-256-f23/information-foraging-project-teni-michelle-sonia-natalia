      <h3>Visual Arts</h3>
      <p>
        At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express 
themselves creatively and artistically.  We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as 
important building blocks in constructing learning.  In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the 
process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those 
manipulations.  We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a 
successful and complete experience.  These art experiences, whether undertaken independently 
or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills, 
strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence.  Materials and 
experiences include: <br>
• Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk <br>
• Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials 
and items  <br>
• Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects  <br>
• Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling <br>
• Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling  <br>
• Shaping/forming and stringing beads <br>
• Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper, pictures, and a variety of three-
dimensional items  <br>
• Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other 
recyclable materials  <br>
• Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials
      </p>

      <h3>Individual Help</h3>
      <p>
        If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety 
of ways, which may include: <br>
• Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking 
process, build trust, and increase student confidence <br>
• Offering more opportunities for exploration <br>
• Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli <br>
• Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration <br>
• Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in 
order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process <br>
• Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular 
concept, skill, or area of concern
