            <strong>Orientation Day:</strong>
            The visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the 
            child and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet 
            the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour. The next day, 
            a child will attend school on his/her own. The class is divided in half.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Parent-Staff Communication:</strong>
            Communication is ongoing through the year. Newsletters, the school website, 
            and meails give you information on current themes, activities, and upcoming events.
            Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child's adjustment,
            observations and/or concerns are common.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences:</strong>
            Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	conversations	and	observations
            both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers keep	notes	on each child,	
            writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	development.	
            Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
            writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	
            plan	activities in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	The school
            has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is informal, while
            the spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher
            conference can be scheduled at any time during the year.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	
            and	nurturing	environment	for	each	child. Classroom	limits	are	necessary	
            to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers	to	spend	as	much	time	
            as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child. <strong>Our rule	of 
            thumb is	that	children	keep	themselves	safe,	keep	friends	safe,	and	
            the	toys	at	school safe.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	
            children	of	appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.</strong>In	
            most	cases,	teachers	can	stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.	
            If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult	the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	
            and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn	their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	
            more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,	more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	
            with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will	lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	
            options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Encouragement	and	pride	in	self	is	the	basis	of	our	discipline	policy.	Our	aim	is	to	have	
            the	children	manage	their	own	actions	and	reactions.	The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children	
            learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            When	inappropriate	behavior	is	a	continuing	problem, the	school	will	work	with	parents	to	
            understand	the	issue	and	make	appropriate	recommendations. It	is	our	goal	to	make	school	
            a	positive,	rewarding	and	enjoyable	experience	for	each	child.
          </li>
          <li>
            We	realize, however,	that	we	cannot	meet	the	needs	of	all	children	and	parents. If	it is	
            determined	that	a	child	is	not	growing	from	his/her	preschool	experience	at	the	Nursery	School, 
            a	discussion	will	be	held	with	parents	at	which	it	may	be	decided	that	this	program	is	not	
            appropriate	for	the	child.	The	director	and	teachers	will	make	recommendations	of	other	preschool	
            programs	and	relevant	community	services	if	parents	so	desire.

            <strong>Parking: </strong>
            Free	parking	is	available	adjacent	to	the	Nursery	School.		These	three, 30-minute	spots	are	
            typically	available	during	the	school	day.		Parking	in	Zone	3	is	only	permitted	with	a	Yellow	
            Zone	3	parking	pass.	 Parents	and	visitors	wishing	to	have a longer	visit	should	park	in	the	
            Millbrook	or	Snow	Way	parking	garages,	located	off	Throop	Drive	and	Snow	Way.		Visitor	
            parking	in	these	lots	is	$2.00	for	the	first	two hours.		The	Nursery	School	will	provide	
            validation	tickets	to	parents	that	park	in	the	garage	for	special	school	events.

            “Popsicles	at	the	Park”	is	held	the	week	prior	to	school	starting.		This	fun	family	event	at	
            Shaw	Park	allows	children	and	parents	to	get	acquainted	with	new	classmates	and	their	
            teachers.		The	last	week	of	school	families	gather	for	a	dinner/potluck	at	Shaw	Park	to

            <strong>Open House: </strong>
            In	October,	WUNS	holds	an	“open	house”	for	current	children	and	their	families.		This	event	
            allows	parents	and	siblings	to	visit	the	child’s	classroom,	meet	the	teachers	and	play	on	the	
            playground.	Children	are	excited	to	“show-off”	their	school	to	their	family.
